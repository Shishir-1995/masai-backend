# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Kanban Board Application

## 1. Overview
The Kanban Board Application is a web-based productivity tool aimed at enabling users to organize and manage tasks through different stages of completion. The application will allow users to create tasks, track their progress, and move them between various columns representing different statuses (e.g., to-do, in progress, done). The application will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with role-based access control (RBAC), user authentication, pagination, and CRUD functionality for task management.

---

## 2. Objectives
- **Provide a flexible Kanban board** for task management.
- **Implement user authentication** using JWT tokens.
- **Allow users to manage tasks** through a visual, drag-and-drop interface.
- **Integrate role-based access control** to define admin and user roles.
- **Implement pagination** to handle large sets of tasks.
- **Deploy the application** to a hosting platform for public access.

## 3. Features & Functionalities

### 3.1 Backend Development (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)
1. **Backend Setup:**
   - Set up Node.js and Express.js server for handling API requests.
   - Integrate MongoDB using Mongoose to store tasks, user data, and roles.

2. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - **JWT Authentication:** Implement user authentication using JWT for secure login and registration.
   - **User Registration:** Allow users to register with a unique username and password.
   - **Login and Logout:** Implement JWT-based login and logout functionality.
   - **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles such as "Admin" and "User." Only admins can perform actions like deleting tasks, while regular users can perform CRUD operations on tasks but cannot delete them.

3. **CRUD Operations:**
   - **Create Tasks:** Users can create tasks with a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., to-do, in progress, done).
   - **Read Tasks:** Users can view tasks based on their status.
   - **Update Tasks:** Users can update task details, including moving tasks between columns (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress").
   - **Delete Tasks:** Admins can delete tasks from the board.
   
4. **Pagination:**
   - Implement pagination to limit the number of tasks displayed per page.
   - Provide query parameters (`page` and `limit`) to control the results.
   - Calculate total tasks and pages for accurate pagination controls.

5. **Swagger API Documentation:**
   - Implement Swagger for documenting the API, including endpoints for CRUD operations, authentication, pagination, and role-based access control.

---

### 3.2 Frontend Development (React.js)
1. **Kanban Board UI:**
   - Display tasks in different columns representing statuses (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to move tasks between columns.
   
2. **Task Management:**
   - Allow users to create new tasks through a form with fields for title, description, due date, and status.
   - Display task details and allow users to edit the information.
   - Allow users to delete tasks (admin only).

3. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Implement a user registration form.
   - Create a login page where users can authenticate using JWT tokens.
   - Handle login state persistence using local storage or cookies.

4. **Pagination:**
   - Display tasks with pagination controls to move between pages of tasks.
   - Ensure pagination works smoothly with the backend API.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Design the frontend UI to be responsive and mobile-friendly.
   - Ensure the application is usable on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

6. **User Experience Enhancements:**
   - Implement smooth animations when tasks are moved between columns.
   - Provide feedback for users, such as loading indicators, success messages, and error handling.

---

### 3.3 Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
1. **Admin Role:**
   - Admins have full access to all CRUD operations, including task creation, updating, and deletion.
   - Admins can view, edit, and delete tasks created by other users.

2. **User Role:**
   - Regular users can only create, update, and move their own tasks.
   - Regular users cannot delete tasks created by themselves or others.

---

### 3.4 Error Handling and Validation
1. **Input Validation:**
   - Ensure proper validation on user inputs (e.g., task title, description, due date) to prevent invalid data.
   - Use server-side validation to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS attacks).
   
2. **Error Handling:**
   - Provide clear and informative error messages in the UI when an error occurs.
   - Handle errors such as failed authentication, missing fields, invalid data, etc.

---

### 3.5 Deployment & Hosting
1. **Frontend Deployment:**
   - Deploy the React.js frontend application on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or other suitable hosting services.
   
2. **Backend Deployment:**
   - Deploy the Node.js and Express.js backend on platforms like Cyclic, EC2, or DigitalOcean.
   - Configure environment variables for sensitive information such as the MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and other credentials.

3. **Database Hosting:**
   - Host the MongoDB database on a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas or a suitable alternative.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Backend Technologies
- **Node.js** for backend server.
- **Express.js** for handling API routes.
- **MongoDB** for the database, using **Mongoose** for schema definition and interactions.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication and secure user sessions.

### 4.2 Frontend Technologies
- **React.js** for building the user interface.
- **Redux** or **Context API** for state management (if needed).
- **React DnD (Drag and Drop)** or another library for task dragging functionality.
- **Axios** for making API requests to the backend.

### 4.3 Development Tools
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and consistent style.
- **Swagger UI** for API documentation.
- **Bcrypt** for password hashing.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
  - Pagination will be used to ensure efficient handling of large task datasets.
  - The application should handle at least 500 concurrent users.

- **Scalability:**
  - The application should be designed to scale by adding more server instances or using a distributed database system if needed.

- **Security:**
  - Ensure the application is secure by using best practices for handling JWT tokens, password storage (bcrypt), and preventing common security vulnerabilities.

- **Usability:**
  - The application should have an intuitive, easy-to-use interface with smooth interactions.
  - Drag-and-drop functionality should be easy to use and responsive.
