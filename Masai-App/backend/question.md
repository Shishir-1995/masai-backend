##### FullStack Project

## Kanban Board

The MERN Stack Kanban Board Application aims to provide students with hands-on experience in building a full-stack web application using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The project will focus on implementing a Kanban board, allowing users to manage tasks through different stages of completion.

### Requirements

---

1. Backend Setup:
    - Set up Node.js and Express.js for the backend server.
    - Connect the backend to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
2. Authentication and Authorization:
    - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    - Allow users to register, login, and logout.
    - Authenticate and authorize users to access certain routes and perform actions based on their role.
3. CRUD Operations:
    - Create tasks: Allow users to create new tasks on the Kanban board.
    - Read tasks: Display tasks on the board categorized by their status (e.g., to-do, in progress, done).
    - Update tasks: Enable users to move tasks between different columns on the board and update task details.
    - Delete tasks: Allow users to delete tasks from the board.
4. Role-based Access Control (RBAC):
    - Define roles such as admin and regular user.
    - Restrict certain actions (e.g., deleting tasks) to specific roles.
5. Pagination:
    - Implement pagination for handling a large number of tasks efficiently.
6. Frontend Development:
    - Set up React.js for the frontend.
    - Design the user interface for the Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality for task movement.
    - Implement forms for creating and editing tasks.
7. Code Quality:
    - Set up coding conventions and linting rules using tools like ESLint.
    - Ensure consistent code style and formatting across the project.
8. Deployment:
    - Deploy the application to a hosting platform such as  Vercel, cyclic, EC2 or Netlify.
    - Configure environment variables for sensitive information such as database credentials and JWT secret.
9. Documentation and ReadMe:
   - Please prepare proper documenatation for both FrontEnd & Backend repos
   - For FrontEnd Repo, add relavant screenshots, working features, backend link and other details in beautified way
   - For Backend Repo, *use swagger API* and mention all the endpoints with request and response and other deatils like auth and all, also mention FrontEnd Deployed Link

### Features and Functionalities

---

1. User Registration and Authentication:
    - Register new users with unique usernames and passwords.
    - Authenticate users using JWT tokens.
    - Handle user sessions and persist login state.
2. Kanban Board Interface:
    - Display tasks in columns representing different stages of completion (e.g., to-do, in progress, done).
    - Allow users to drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status.
3. Task Management:
    - Create new tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates.
    - View task details and edit task information.
    - Delete tasks from the board.
4. Role-based Access Control:
    - Define roles such as admin and regular user.
    - Admins have full access to CRUD operations, while regular users have limited access.
5. Pagination:
    - Limit the number of tasks displayed on each page to improve performance.
    - Provide navigation controls for users to move between pages.
6. Error Handling and Validation:
    - Validate user input to ensure data integrity and prevent common security vulnerabilities.
    - Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to users.
7. Deployment and Hosting:
    - Deploy the application to a hosting platform for public access.
    - Ensure the application is secure and scalable for production use.
8. User Experience Enhancements:
    - Implement responsive design for the frontend to support various devices.
    - Add animations and visual feedback to improve user interaction.
